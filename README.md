I love spending my free time with playing Genshin Impact, Honkai: star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero and Wuthering Waves.

You can see me often in pt, mostly behind the Bakery somewhere.
I also enjoy spending time with my friends. My personality is ISTJ. I dont talk a lot, but my friends often talk for me, so yea.
My Heart simply loves fictional characters. especially Kinich, Sunday and Brant.
